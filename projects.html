    <p><h1>Hello</h1>
My name is Eva. I am an MA student in NYU Journalism’s <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/graduate/programs/studio-20-digital-first/">Studio20</a> program where I am studying innovation in digital journalism. Before coming to NYU I attended the University of Washington where I completed a B.A in Communications and a B.S. in Computer Science so most of my studies revolve around the intersection between these two things.
I’m fascinated by all of the new avenues being explored within digital story telling and am particularly interested in the area of <a href="http://projects.nyujournalism.org/newsliteracy2016/topics/content-management-systems/">newsroom tools and workflows and how they fit together</a>.
Current projects
Currently I am focusing a lot on my thesis, a research project in digital preservation that focuses particularly on how data driven news applications can be preserved. I am also working on a full redesign of the NYU Applied Psychology website in partnership with the school web team, as well as  expanding on my work in data story telling for <a href="http://campaign-finance.org">campaign-finance.org</a> with exploration of FEC data using Neo4j and Linkurious. </p>
