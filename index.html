    <p><h1>Hello</h1>
My name is Eva. I am a recent graduate of NYU Journalism’s <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/graduate/programs/studio-20-digital-first/">Studio20</a> program where I studied technology and innovation in media. Before coming to NYU I attended the University of Washington Tacoma where I completed a B.A in Communications and a B.S. in Computer Science so most of my studies revolve around the intersection between these two things.
I’m fascinated by all of the new avenues being explored within digital storytelling and am particularly interested in data journalism, as well as the area of <a href="http://projects.nyujournalism.org/newsliteracy2016/topics/content-management-systems/">newsroom tools and workflows and how they fit together</a>.</p>
<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<p>During my final semester I began work on a thesis project in digital preservation that focuses particularly on how data driven news applications can be archived, and I plan to continue with that research. For my job as Digital Production Assistant at the NYU Department of Applied Psychology I am working on a full redesign of the NYU Applied Psychology Department website in partnership with the Steinhardt web team. And I am expanding on my work in data storytelling for <a href="http://campaign-finance.org">campaign-finance.org</a> with exploration of FEC data using Neo4j and Linkurious. </p>
